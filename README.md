# How to run

Before running the app deploy the local server first. Once local server is deployed run npm start and it will show up
with your device as local host.

(run server by node server.js btw. I'm using mongo compass so connect on that and you can access the database w a gui too)

Then upload a xlsx file to the prompt and it will auto parse to the schema found in schema.js in folder DrugCatalog in the server side of 
the app. Then it will store in the db w the mongo compass u can see the stored data easily.
